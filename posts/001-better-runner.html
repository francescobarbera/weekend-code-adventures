            Running with an engineer's precision: crafting a better runner with TypeScript
        </h1>
        <p>
            As someone who finds inspiration in the rhythmic pounding of feet against the pavement and the rhythm of the fingers on a keyboard (I am addicted to ASMR coding streamers on Twitch), I often seek ways to look at these two activities with the same eyes. Running and software development might seem worlds apart, but they share a common thread: the pursuit of improvement. This quest led me to create <strong>Better runner</strong>, a straightforward Node.js application designed to calculate and display essential information about my runs and other activities I use to improve my shape. <a href="https://github.com/francescobarbera/better-runner" target="_blank">Here</a> is the public repository.
        </p>
        <h2>The motivation behind Better runner</h2>
        <p>
            Like many runners, I enjoy tracking my progress. Apps like Strava offer a wealth of features, providing detailed analytics and a vibrant community. However, I found that while these platforms are comprehensive, they can be somewhat restrictive when it comes to extracting and analyzing specific data points that matter most to me. Furthermore, I am a fan of the "less is more" approach and I wanted a simple tool that would allow me to track my progress without any unnecessary features.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, Strava's segmentation feature is excellent for predefined routes, but it doesn't allow for easy comparison of my preferred splits unless they are already established segments. I wanted a simple tool that focuses on the metrics I care about most—total distance, duration, elevation gain, and the ability to analyze these over time without unnecessary complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another reason for creating <strong>Better runner</strong> was that I am a supporter of local-first software and I wanted to have a tool that would allow me to store my data locally and not in the cloud. I wanted to have full control over my data and not to be dependent on any third-party service.
        </p>
        <h2>Embracing manual data entry</h2>
        <p>
            One might argue that manual data entry is a step backward in our age of automation. However, I've found value in the process of inputting my run data by hand. Spending an hour (or more) running and then taking a couple of minutes to record the details isn't just a chore; it's an opportunity for reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manual entry ensures that I pay closer attention to my data, leading to a deeper understanding of my performance. It forces me to engage with each run individually, noticing patterns and insights I might otherwise overlook if the data were automatically logged and processed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two obvious downsides of manual typing are the possibilities to make mistakes and the difficulty of filling a JavaScript object on a mobile phone. These are two side effects that (for now) I am willing to accept in exchange for the benefits of manual data entry.
        </p>
        <h2>Why TypeScript?</h2>
        <p>
            As a developer, I spend most of my time in a text editor (I recommend <a href="https://zed.dev" target="_blank">Zed</a>). The simplicity and speed of typing out code and data far outweigh the benefits of more visual tools for me. TypeScript, in particular, offers a robust environment that helps me avoid common mistakes through its strong typing system and on-the-fly checks.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using TypeScript for <strong>Better runner</strong>, I gain a clearer understanding of the data structures I'm working with. It enhances my coding efficiency and reduces the likelihood of errors that could skew my running data analysis.
        </p>
        <h2>Storing data without a database</h2>
        <p>
            Given the relatively small amount of data I expect to handle, I've opted not to use a traditional database. Instead, I store my run data directly in a TypeScript file. This approach simplifies the process, allowing me to quickly add, remove, or modify data without the overhead of database management.
        </p>
        <p>Here's an example of how I store the data (it is only a partial view, for a complete view, you can check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/francescobarbera/better-runner" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-typescript">
type Activity = {
  date: string;
  distanceKm: number;
  durationSeconds: number;
  averageHeartRate: number;
  withHeartRateMonitor: boolean;
  activeKilocalories: number;
  averagePowerW: number;
  comment: string;
  externalLinks: ExternalLink[];
};

type Run = (
  | {
      type: "SLOW_RUN" | "RACE" | "BY_FEEL";
    }
  | {
      type: "FARTLEK";
      customSplits: Split[];
    }
) & {
  averagePaceMinutesPerKm: number;
  elevationGainMeters: number;
  averageCadence: number;
} & Activity;

const run: Run[] = [
  {
    type: "SLOW_RUN",
    date: "2024-09-17",
    distanceKm: 9.5,
    durationSeconds: 52 * 60 + 4,
    averagePaceMinutesPerKm: 5.29,
    averageHeartRate: 141,
    averageCadence: 177,
    averagePowerW: 205,
    elevationGainMeters: 57,
    withHeartRateMonitor: true,
    activeKilocalories: 562,
    comment: "A good slow run with some music",
    externalLinks: [
      {
        platform: "STRAVA",
        url: "https://www.strava.com/activities/strava_id",
      },
    ],
    // more runs
  },
];
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            This method keeps everything in one place and leverages TypeScript's type-checking to ensure data integrity.
        </p>
        <h2>Building the application</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Better runner</strong> is built with simplicity in mind. The core functionality revolves around reading the run data and calculating cumulative statistics. Here's a high-level overview of the application's structure:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Data input</strong>: Run data is stored in a TypeScript
                file as shown above.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data processing</strong>: The application reads the data and performs calculations such as total distance covered, average pace, total elevation gain, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data display</strong>: Results are displayed in the console.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sample output</h3>
        <p>When the application runs, it generates output like:</p>
        <pre><code>
┌──────────────────────────┬────────┐
│ (index)                  │ Values │
├──────────────────────────┼────────┤
│ totalKm                  │ 70.62  │
│ totalDurationSeconds     │ 23927  │
│ averageDurationSeconds   │ 2392   │
│ totalElevationGainMeters │ 1815   │
└──────────────────────────┴────────┘
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            I know I can do better. But this output only provides a quick snapshot of my running performance over time and can be easily improved by adding more data and better presentation.
        </p>
        <h2>Advantages of this approach</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Customization</strong>: I have complete control over what data is collected and how it's analyzed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Flexibility</strong>: adding new metrics or modifying existing ones is straightforward.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Dependencies</strong>: without relying on external services or databases, the application remains lightweight and easy to maintain.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Learning Opportunity</strong>: building <strong>Better runner</strong> hasn't necessarily enhanced my understanding of TypeScript (in the end, it is a small application), but it will allow me to experiment extensively with other technologies. Since I use it daily, I can observe the improvements continuously.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Challenges faced</h2>
        <p>
            While the project has been rewarding, it hasn't been without challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Data accuracy</strong>: manual data entry can lead to errors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scalability</strong>: storing data in a TypeScript file is practical for a small dataset, but it may become unmanageable as the data grows. I may consider integrating a lightweight database in the future if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Feature limitations</strong>: the application lacks the advanced features of commercial apps, such as GPS mapping and community interaction (I still use Strava for both of them). However, for my purposes, these aren't essential.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Future plans</h2>
        <p>I'm considering adding the following features to <strong>Better runner</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Graphical data visualization</strong>: incorporating charts to visualize progress over time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Goal tracking</strong>: setting and monitoring goals for distance, pace, or elevation gain.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Integration with devices</strong>: since manual entry has some benefits, I believe in the long term they will not overcome the downsides, so the idea is to explore options to import data from running watches or smartphones to reduce manual entry while retaining control over the data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Building <strong>Better runner</strong> has been an exercise in combining my love for running with my passion for software development. It serves as a personalized tool that meets my specific needs without unnecessary complexity. By embracing manual data entry and leveraging TypeScript, I've created an application that not only tracks my runs but also enhances my understanding of my performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            By focusing on a local-first approach, I ensure that my data remains private and under my control, free from reliance on third-party services. It's about finding what works best for me and enjoying the process of creation along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project reminds me that sometimes, simplicity and control are more valuable than a plethora of features.
