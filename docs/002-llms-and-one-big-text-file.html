                <h2>Apps, apps, and more apps</h2>
                <p>
                    They have a shiny design, they have attractive colours, they
                    make you feel like a better person, the CEO of a great
                    startup. That’s what apps do to me (and, I think, to many
                    people). You need them to organise your life and achieve
                    your goals. You need them for every single aspect of your
                    life: from tracking your sleep to brushing your teeth.
                </p>
                <h2>Going for simplicity</h2>
                <p>
                    I am at a point in my life where I do not want to be
                    stressed by constant (and often useless) notifications. I do
                    not want to be distracted by my watch asking me if I am
                    riding a bike. I probably already know that I am.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the key aspects I want to improve is daily
                    organisation. I have three kids who need to be picked up
                    from school or kindergarten, so every movement must be well
                    organised. I discovered online the “one big text file”
                    pattern:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a
                            href="https://dkphhh.me/reading/2024-08-07_00-08-00"
                            target="_blank"
                            >My One Big Text File</a
                        >
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a
                            href="https://www.leonardobighi.com/how-i-organize-my-life-in-plain-text"
                            target="_blank"
                            >How I Organize My Life in Plain Text</a
                        >
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I tried it for a couple of weeks, improving and adapting the
                    structure based on what I saw working well and what could be
                    improved. I put almost everything in the file. Here is an
                    example:
                </p>
                <pre><code># 2026-01-26
**07:00** wake up and prepare for the new week.
**09:30** sprint planning meeting.
**11:30** sync for the new feature.
**12:00** 10k slow run.
**13:00** lunch.
**13:30** start working on the new feature. [TODO]
**17:30** wrap up the day.
**21:00** watching the big match.</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The format is quite simple: a big markdown file with an easy
                    structure. It worked quite well. I usually write the next
                    day’s plan the day before, so I already know what I have to
                    do and where the friction points might be.
                </p>
                <h2>I was happy with my file, but maybe…</h2>
                <p>
                    The big file is really handy. I can search for any activity
                    I have done in the past and immediately get a result. There
                    is no need to jump between different apps for different
                    kinds of information. Everything is in one place:
                    appointments, notes, todos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Postponing an activity is just moving a line. Adding notes
                    means adding a line and starting to write.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's difficult with the large file is to extract
                    meaningful information: you have to go through many lines
                    looking for specific words and then summarise what you
                    found. But since a large part of my workflow already
                    revolves around LLMs (I am joking… mostly), why not add a
                    bit of magic? That is how <strong>Ambrogio</strong> was
                    born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ambrogio</strong> takes its name from the Ferrero
                    Rocher commercials: the discreet, always-present butler who
                    anticipates needs and quietly solves problems. It is not
                    about replacing you, but about helping you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ambrogio</strong> is powered by an LLM. LLMs are
                    very good at working with text files. You just need to teach
                    them the structure, and then you can start asking questions
                    about what you have to do tomorrow, which tasks you have not
                    finished yet, and so on.
                </p>
                <h2>Let’s go technical</h2>
                <p>
                    The technical choices behind Ambrogio follow the same
                    principle as the organiser file: keep things simple, local
                    (if you can use a local LLM), and under control. The
                    implementation reflects that more than any architectural
                    ambition. I wrote the app in <strong>Rust</strong>. I
                    started using it a couple of months ago and I am still not
                    proficient with it, so I rely heavily on AI (<strong
                        >Claude Code</strong
                    >) to help me write the code. You can see Claude involved in
                    almost every commit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file that I reuse across
                    many projects. After several iterations, I found a way to
                    guide the LLM towards the structure I have in mind, and it
                    works quite well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I run the app from the terminal. It is configured to use my
                    daily organiser file. When I start it, I can ask different
                    kinds of questions. In these early days, I mostly use it to
                    summarise notes from the past few weeks or to prepare for
                    specific meetings. So far, I am quite happy with how it
                    works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ambrogio</strong> works with an LLM of your choice.
                    It sends the content of your big text file to the model and
                    lets you ask questions. That’s it.
                </p>
                <h2>Little tools with a bright future</h2>
                <p>
                    I started this post complaining about apps. Ambrogio is not
                    an alternative app, but a way out of that pattern: no
                    dashboards, no notifications, just a tool that answers when
                    I ask. My initial idea was to start from small sources of
                    friction and try to solve them in a couple of hours. Thanks
                    to the power of AI, and the experience I have built using
                    it, I am able to produce something reasonably useful with a
                    few well-crafted prompts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is plenty of room for improvement: structured outputs
                    for todos, colours, better formatting.
                    <strong>Kaizen</strong> is the way. Small improvements every
                    time I notice something that can be done better.
