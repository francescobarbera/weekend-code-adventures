                <h2>AI made it easy</h2>
                <p>
                    The time between imagining something (software in our case)
                    and using a working version has been reduced by AI. It's not
                    about creating a production-ready application in 10 minutes,
                    that's still not possible, in my opinion. It's more about
                    creating prototypes quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recently changed my way of developing from bottom-up to
                    top-down: I have an idea, I ask the LLM to implement
                    something (giving it a strong guideline) and I test whether
                    the functionality I created is really worth it. If so, I go
                    deeper into the implementation details. Before LLMs, most of
                    the work was creating building blocks and connecting them.
                </p>
                <h2>Kaizen!</h2>
                <p>
                    Every day is an opportunity to learn something. Every point
                    of friction is an opportunity for improvement. I always
                    struggled with how to efficiently manage my time. Now that I
                    am a freelancer, I have to manage multiple small projects.
                    Some customers use Jira, some others use different tools. I
                    felt the need to use something of my own, something not
                    shared with the customer, for example to handle personal
                    tasks (like this blog).
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is where Ambrogio came in. The name is commonly used to
                    indicate a butler, at least in Italy, where an ad in the
                    1980s popularized this name. I started Ambrogio as a simple
                    bot that can read a large personal plain-text file I use to
                    organise my life and store information (take a look at
                    <a href="002-llms-and-one-big-text-file.html"
                        >LLMs and one big text file</a
                    >).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried it for a couple of days and honestly, I found it was
                    not so useful. I kept the functionality, and from time to
                    time I still use it to look for specific information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I moved to something I already knew was useful: a
                    pomodoro timer. I've been a fan of Francesco Cirillo's work
                    for many years, but I always struggled with all the apps I
                    have used: some were too chaotic, some too minimalistic. Why
                    not implement something shaped around me now that I have
                    these superpowers?
                </p>
                <h2>Pomodoro + task manager</h2>
                <p>
                    I became a fan of the command line. Using the keyboard a lot
                    and the mouse less feels natural to me. I even miss
                    smartphones with physical keyboards. I don't like tools with
                    too many visual effects that can distract me. So, with my
                    new friend Claude, I implemented a small CLI with a pomodoro
                    timer inside Ambrogio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The natural continuation was to implement a task manager. I
                    have different customers, so it made sense to add the
                    concept of projects. And if you have tasks, sometimes you
                    have to take notes, for example about what you have done and
                    the difficulties you found.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my super-productive friend everything was quite smooth.
                    The interesting part was that I didn't have to prioritise
                    the design of the commands. I directly implemented them,
                    used Ambrogio with the new features for a couple of hours
                    and, if a feature was good, I refactored the code to fit my
                    standards.
                </p>
                <h2>About the structure</h2>
                <p>
                    My last experience with plain text files was great, so I
                    continue using them for keeping the tasks and the pomodoros.
                    The interesting part is that I can simply open the text file
                    if I want to fix a typo, or in general change something. I
                    don't need complex features implemented. Here is an example:

                <h2>Having fun with it</h2>
                <p>
                    Building my own tool means I can do whatever I want, for
                    example, why not make my office light blink at the end of a
                    pomodoro? I built a hook I can use to trigger a behaviour
                    and created a script to change my Philips Hue bulb color.
                    That was it. It was fun and my daughters were surprised to
                    see the light automagically change color without pressing a
                    button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did the same with Claude, precisely when it finishes a
                    task. That was also a lot of fun.
                </p>
                <h2>Is it because of LLMs?</h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, working on Ambrogio has been interesting for two
                    reasons: I can build a tool I use every day, and I can
                    improve it quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before, I was not doing this because of all the setup work:
                    boilerplate, integrations, and constant context switching.
                    Most of the core logic is simple, but the setup can drain
                    your time and energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where LLMs make a big difference for me: they reduce
                    that friction, help me read docs faster, and connect
                    concepts across tools. Modern stacks are now very complex,
                    and this is the key point for me. So the real question is
                    not if we should use LLMs, but how to reduce complexity so
                    one person can still manage an entire system.
                </p>
